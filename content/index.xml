			<h3 class="bold">THE ADC MISSION</h3>

			<h3 class="bold">THE ADC VISION</h3>
			<p>At ADC we truly believe that anyone can dance. Thereâ€™s so many reasons people want to be a part of a dance family, from the love of the art form to the close relationships built through spending hours practicing together to share a stage. But to be a part of a strong team in adulthood, you typically need to have a strong dance foundation and/or need to be pursuing dance professionally. But amateur dancers need a space to grow with a team through the art form too. Attending dance classes and workshops can help, but being a part of a consistent team who works towards goals together brings a whole different level of community.
</p>
            <p>ADC exists to give exploratory creatives a dance home. We strive to provide the confidence, community, and connection that comes with being a part of and growing with a dance team, regardless of where someone is in the world or in their dance journey</p>
